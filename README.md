# DataAnalysis
Data anaylysis procedures controled by parameters stored in a SQLITE data base. The goal of these procedures is to perform a fine analysis of the digitizer files where particle signals are fond and the peak height above a polynomial background is determiend. The measured digitizer data can also be corrected by the fitted backgroup to improve pead finding and fitting in several iteration steps. Using the fittes results 2d histograms are build which can then be used to determine particle rates as a function of time. All results and parameters are recorded in the SQLITE data base. 


## Main Content:

- *example\_fitting.py*  : perform the multi-stage fitting analysis to obtain the best signal height determinations
-  *example\_rate\_analysis.py* : determine particle rates and fille 2d time vs signal height histogram
-  *online\_analysis.py* : module to for a quick analysis of a shot
-  *online\_analyze\_new\_shot.py* : short example script to analyze a new shot (includes automaticall adding new database entries)
-  *LR\_deconvolute\_histo.py* : example of performing a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution of a histogram to improve resolution. The point spread function can be fitted either with a modified Voigt function or a sum of gaussian (SOG)
-  *various .db files* : several example SQLITE data base filesâ€¨- **analysis\_modules** : directory where are the needed modules are located


This an ongoing development and not yet in its final state. 

## Compilation of *.f90 routines

Currently the Makefile might not work. The work around is to compile the 2 needed fortran files as follows:

- *ffind\_peaks2.f90*  : f2py \-m ffind\_peaks2 \-c ffind\_peaks2.f90
- *lfitm1.f90* : f2py \-m lfitm1 \-c lfitm1.f90
